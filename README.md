# Automated Google Spreadsheet Signup Bot

Have you ever had to sign up for office hours in Google Sheets?
Are you worried that the sheet will be posted at an unavailable time?

Do you like being away from your email and would like to fill in the office hours sheet as soon as it is posted?

If you answered yes to any of the questions, I can help you.

This app allows you to seamlessly sign up for office hours and not worry about being late and missing out.
Simply provide a link to your google sheet, submit your name and email address as well as the row and column of the table for your slot.

The app will do the rest. It will be checking if your slot becomes empty and will instantly fill it in again allowing you to be ahead of everyone else?
What if your slot is taken by someone who is not you? The app will find the next available slot given your time limits!

Try it out.
